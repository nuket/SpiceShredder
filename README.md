# IKEA Spice Shredder

This is a project to motorize an [IKEA 365+ IHÄRDIG](https://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/usearch/?query=IH%C3%84RDIG) spice grinder using a 3D-printed drill adapter.

## Rationale

After spending 15 minutes using the IKEA 365+ IHÄRDIG spice grinder to make curry powder from whole spices by hand (and damn near giving myself a repetitive stress injury with a clockwise twisting motion), I decided that the best solution would be to hook up a drill, and use electricity to do the work instead.

Coffee and spice grinders are expensive. IKEA is affordable. And 3D printing is pretty cheap too, once you have a printer.

So the idea is to create a plastic piece that can grip the spice grinder, and then rotate the entire glass container rapidly.

## Measurements

The IHÄRDIG spice grinder has a 6.5cm diameter at the base, and tapers slightly inwards about 1mm per 2 centimeters of cylinder height.

The business end of the largest hex-head-driver in a standard IKEA [FIXA](https://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/usearch/?query=fixa) toolkit is around 3 - 3.5mm per edge and 1cm long.

This does not work because the way the 2mm-thick walls are printed up, they are both brittle and very inflexible. They do not grip the glass walls of the spice grinder.
